# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
require(data.table)
require(curl)

#store the url in a variable
urlfile<-'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv'
#read it in as dataframe with curl
cocktail_data<-as.data.frame(fread(urlfile))

```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
library(tidyr)

#creating cleaned dataframe, first we split ingredients with the substring between them, then we use regex to clear out unneccessary values
cocktail_data_cleaned = cocktail_data %>% 
    mutate(ingredients = strsplit(as.character(ingredients), "<br/>")) %>% 
    unnest(ingredients) %>%
    mutate(ingredients = gsub("(.*\\s(oz|dashes|bsp|dash|drops|drop)\\s|\\s[(].*[)])", "", ingredients))

head(cocktail_data_cleaned)

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
#this is the list of ingredients, however...
ingredient_list_abc = sort(unique(cocktail_data_cleaned$ingredients))

#there is an "or" conditional ingredient in one cocktail, but both of those are not unique
ingredients_all_orsplit = unlist(strsplit(cocktail_data_cleaned$ingredients, " or "))
ingredient_list_abc_split = sort(unique(ingredients_all_orsplit))

ingredient_list_abc_split

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
#we use the list where we splitted the "or" statement
different_ingredients = length(ingredient_list_abc_split)
different_ingredients
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
#we are working with all the ingredients, where we split up the "or" conditional ingredient
#with ties, all the ingredients show up
ingredients_frequency = data.table(sort(table(ingredients_all_orsplit),decreasing=TRUE))
top10_ties = ingredients_frequency[, head(.SD, 10), by="N"]
top10_ties
#without ties
top10_noties = sort(table(ingredients_all_orsplit),decreasing=TRUE)[1:10]
top10_noties
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
#we use the cleaned dataframe not splitted for the "or", because it counts as one ingredient
ingredient_num_table = cocktail_data_cleaned %>%
    group_by(name) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(Count = n()) %>%
    arrange(desc(Count))
maximum_ingrdient = max(ingredient_num_table$Count)
maximum_ingrdient

#filtered cocktails, that have the most ingredients
ingredient_num_table[ingredient_num_table$Count == maximum_ingrdient,]

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
#we use the list with "or" splitted, because we are interested about all the ingredients
rare_ingredients = names(table(ingredients_all_orsplit))[table(ingredients_all_orsplit) == 1]
length(rare_ingredients)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
#introducing new column to log if ingredient is rare or not (1 or 0)
cocktail_data_cleaned$RareIngrdient <- as.numeric(cocktail_data_cleaned$ingredients %in% rare_ingredients)
#select only those cocktails that have ingredients with 1 in RareIngredient column
cocktails_with_rare = sort(unique(cocktail_data_cleaned$name[cocktail_data_cleaned$RareIngrdient == 1]))
#list of cocktails and number of them
cocktails_with_rare
length(cocktails_with_rare)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
#using the same column from before, but we aggregate ingredient rareness and only keep those that are 0, so no rare ingredients were among their ingredients
cocktails_without_rare = cocktail_data_cleaned %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(IngredientRareness = sum(RareIngrdient)) %>%
  filter(IngredientRareness == 0)
#list of cocktails and number of them
cocktails_without_rare$name
length(cocktails_without_rare$name)

```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
#using reshape's dcast to create the matrix
library(reshape2)
cocktail_cheatsheet = dcast(as.data.table(cocktail_data_cleaned), name~ingredients, length)

#rename the defaults
cocktail_cheatsheet[cocktail_cheatsheet == 0] <- ""
cocktail_cheatsheet[cocktail_cheatsheet == 1] <- "x"

cocktail_cheatsheet

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
