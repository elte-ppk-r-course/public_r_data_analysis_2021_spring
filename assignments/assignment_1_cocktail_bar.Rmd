# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)



```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail <- readr::read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")


```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
#We first separate the ingredients in multiple rows
cocktail <-  separate_rows(cocktail, ingredients, sep = "<b4/>", convert = TRUE)
#We can verify all the ingredients are in individual rows
print(cocktail$ingredients)

```
```{r}
#We remove all types of quantities and all alchohol content e.g 40% abv and 100-proof

c_cocktail <-
  cocktail %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub(".*oz|[0-9]|bsp|dashes|dash|drop|drops|-proof|\\(.*", "", ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients, side = "left"))
  
print(c_cocktail$ingredients)

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}

#We select the ingredients row and eliminated duplicated values
ingredients_l <-  distinct(c_cocktail[,8, drop = FALSE])
#We order the row alphabetically
ingredients_list <- ingredients_l[order(ingredients_list$ingredients),]
#List is ready to be sent 
View(ingredients_list)



```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
#We count the number of unique occurances
n_of_ingredients <- n_distinct(ingredients_list)

print(n_of_ingredients)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
#Top 10 ingredients without tie
top_10_ingredients <- sort(table(c_cocktail$ingredients),decreasing=TRUE)[1:10]
print(top_10_ingredients)
#Top 10 ingredients with tie
top_10_ingredients_tie <- sort(table(c_cocktail$ingredients),decreasing=TRUE)[1:11]
print(top_10_ingredients_tie)


```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
#We group by cocktail and count all distinct ingredients, then sort them by frequency and then filter the cocktails with the most ingredients
number_ingredients <- c_cocktail %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarize(count_ing = n_distinct(ingredients)) %>%
  arrange(desc(count_ing)) %>%
  filter(count_ing == max(count_ing))
  
view(number_ingredients)

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
rare_ingredients <- names(table(c_cocktail$ingredients))[table(c_cocktail$ingredients) == 1]
length(rare_ingredients)


view(rare_ingredients)



```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
rare_cocktail <- names(table(c_cocktail$name))[table(c_cocktail$ingredients) == 1]


view(rare_cocktail)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
