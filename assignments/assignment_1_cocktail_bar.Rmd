# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r read TSV}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv"
download.file(url, "cocktails_data.tsv")
cocktails <- read.csv("cocktails_data.tsv", header = T, sep = "\t")
#View(cocktails)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
cocktails <- cocktails %>% separate_rows("ingredients", sep = "<br/>")
cocktails <- cocktails %>% separate_rows("ingredients", sep = "<br>")
cocktails <- cocktails %>% separate_rows("ingredients", sep = "<b4/>")

cocktails <- cocktails %>% tidyr::separate(col = "ingredients", into = c("amount","ingredient"), sep = "oz|drops|drop|dashes|dash|bsp")

cocktails <- cocktails %>% tidyr::separate(col = "ingredient", into = c("ingredient","alc.indicator"), sep = "[()]")

#remove first & last white spaces from 'ingredient' vector:
cocktails$ingredient <- cocktails$ingredient %>% trimws

head(cocktails)
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredients <- cocktails$ingredient %>% unique %>% sort
ingredients
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
length(ingredients)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}

print('Top 10 ingredients w/ number of occurences:')
occurrence <- cocktails$ingredient %>% table %>% sort
occurrence %>% tail(10)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
ingredient.sum <- cocktails %>% group_by(name) %>% count(ingredient) %>% summarise(ing.num = sum(n))

max.ingredients <- ingredient.sum$ing.num %>% max

ingredient.sum %>% filter(ing.num == max.ingredients)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
occurrence %>% as_tibble() %>% filter(n == 1) %>% nrow
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
rare <- occurrence %>% as_tibble() %>% filter(n == 1) 
names(rare)[1] <- "ing"
rare <- rare$ing

c.rare <- cocktails %>% filter(ingredient %in% rare) %>% select(1)
c.rare
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
cocktails.names <- cocktails$name %>% unique
cocktails.nonrare <- cocktails.names[!(cocktails.names %in% c.rare$name)]
cocktails.nonrare
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
cheatsheet <- cocktails[,c("name","ingredient")] %>% table 
cheatsheet <- cheatsheet %>% as.data.frame()
cheatsheet$Freq <- cheatsheet$Freq %>% as.character()
cheatsheet$Freq[cheatsheet$Freq == "0"] <- ""
cheatsheet$Freq[cheatsheet$Freq == "1"] <- "X"

cheatsheet <- cheatsheet %>% spread(ingredient,Freq)
cheatsheet
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
