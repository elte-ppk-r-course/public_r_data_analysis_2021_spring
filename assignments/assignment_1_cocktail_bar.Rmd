# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
# Read the data

cocktail <- readr::read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")

```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
#We first separate the ingredients in multiple rows
cocktail_s <-  separate_rows(cocktail,ingredients, 
                             sep = "<b4/>", convert = TRUE)
cocktail_s2 <- separate_rows(cocktail_s, ingredients, 
                             sep = "<br/>", convert = TRUE)
cocktail <- separate_rows(cocktail_s2, ingredients, 
                          sep = "<br>", convert = TRUE)
# Verify all the ingredients are in individual rows
print(cocktail$ingredients)
```

Remove all quantities
```{r}
#We remove all types of quantities and all alcohol content e.g 40% abv and 100-proof

c_cocktail <-
  cocktail %>%
  mutate(ingredients =
           gsub(".*oz|[0-9]|bsp|dashes|dash|drop|drops|-proof|\\(.*", "", ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_to_lower(ingredients))%>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients, side = "both"))
  
print(c_cocktail$ingredients)

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
# Select the ingredients row and eliminate duplicated values
ingredients_l <-  distinct(c_cocktail[,8, drop = FALSE])
# Order the row alphabetically
ingredients_list <- ingredients_l[order(ingredients_l$ingredients),]
# List is ready to be sent 
view(ingredients_list)

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
# Count the number of unique occurances
n_of_ingredients <- n_distinct(ingredients_l)

print(n_of_ingredients)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
# Top 10 ingredients without tie
top_10_ingredients <- sort(table(c_cocktail$ingredients),decreasing=TRUE)[1:10]
print(top_10_ingredients)
# Top 10 ingredients with tie
top_10_ingredients_tie <- sort(table(c_cocktail$ingredients),decreasing=TRUE)[1:11]
print(top_10_ingredients_tie)

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
# Group by cocktail and count all distinct ingredients, then sort them by frequency and then filter the cocktails with the most ingredients
number_ingredients <- c_cocktail %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(count_ing = n_distinct(ingredients)) %>%
  arrange(desc(count_ing)) %>%
  filter(count_ing == max(count_ing))
  
view(number_ingredients)

# Number of cocktails
n_distinct(c_cocktail$name)

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
# Table with ingredients that appear only once
rare_ingredients <- names(table(c_cocktail$ingredients))[table(c_cocktail$ingredients) == 1]

view(rare_ingredients)
# Number of ingredients that appear in only one cocktail
length(rare_ingredients)

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
# Table with cocktails that has rare ingredients
rare_cocktail <- names(table(c_cocktail$name))[table(c_cocktail$ingredients) == 1]
# Remove empty rows
rare_cocktail <- remove_empty(as.data.frame(rare_cocktail))

view(rare_cocktail)

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
# Table with cocktails that has no rare ingredients
notrare_cocktails <- names(table(c_cocktail$name))[table(c_cocktail$ingredients) > 1]
# Remove empty rows
notrare_cocktails <- remove_empty(as.data.frame(notrare_cocktails))

view(notrare_cocktails)

```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
cocktail_og <- readr::read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
view(cocktail_og)


# Create a list with all cocktail names
matrix_rows <- list(unique(c_cocktail$name))[[1]]
# Create a list with all ingredients
matrix_columns <- list(unique(c_cocktail$ingredients))[[1]]
# Count number of rows for creating matrix
numrows <- length(matrix_rows)
# Count number of columns for creating matrix
numcolumns <- length(matrix_columns)
# Variable that will contain the list
matrix_values <- list()

# Set the Matrix values
i <- 1
for (ingredient in matrix_columns) {
  for (c in matrix_rows) {
    c_ingredients = (cocktail_og %>% filter(name == c))['ingredients']
    # Check if cocktail contains the ingredient
    if(grepl(tolower(ingredient), tolower(c_ingredients))) {
      matrix_values[[i]] <- 'X'
    } else {
      matrix_values[[i]] <- ''
    }
    i <- i + 1
  }
}
# Create Matrix
cocktail_matrix <- matrix(matrix_values, numrows, dimnames = list(c(matrix_rows) , c(matrix_columns)))

view(cocktail_matrix)
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
