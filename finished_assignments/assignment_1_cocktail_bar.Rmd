# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there. DONE

```{r}
cocktail_data <- readr:: read_tsv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv"), na = c(" ", "NA", "Unknown"))
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
cocktail_data_clean <- cocktail_data %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>|<br>|<b4>|<b>|<b>\\s|\\sor\\s") %>%
  mutate(ingredients,
          ingredients = gsub("[0-9]|oz\\s|dashes\\s|drops\\s|abv|%|\\(|\\)|\\/|\\.", "", ingredients),
          ingredients = str_trim(ingredients),
          ingredients = tolower(ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients, ingredients = as.factor(ingredients))%>%
  slice(-c(16))
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredients_list <- cocktail_data_clean %>%
  count(ingredients) %>%
  select(ingredients)

print.data.frame(ingredients_list)
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
ingredients_number <- ingredients_list %>%
  summarize(number_rows = n())

print.data.frame(ingredients_number)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
ingredients_most_used <- cocktail_data_clean %>%
  count(ingredients, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 10, with_ties = TRUE) %>%
  select(ingredients)

print.data.frame(ingredients_most_used)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
cocktail_most_ingredient <- cocktail_data_clean %>%
  count(name) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 1, with_ties = TRUE)

print.data.frame(cocktail_most_ingredient)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
cocktail_one_ingredient <- cocktail_data_clean %>%
  count(name) %>%
  filter(n == 1)

print.data.frame(cocktail_one_ingredient)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
cocktail_rare_ingredients <- cocktail_data_clean %>%
  add_count(ingredients, name = "ingredients_frequency") %>%
  filter(ingredients_frequency == 1) %>%
  select(name, ingredients)

print.data.frame(cocktail_rare_ingredients)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
cocktail_common_ingredients <- cocktail_data_clean %>%
  add_count(ingredients, name = "ingredients_frequency") %>%
  filter(ingredients_frequency > 1) %>%
  count(name) %>%
  select(name)

print.data.frame(cocktail_common_ingredients)
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```


```{r}
matrix_ingredients <- cocktail_data_clean %>%
  mutate(index, X = "X") %>%
  select(name, ingredients, X) %>%
  spread(ingredients, X, fill = "")

print.data.frame(matrix_ingredients)
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
